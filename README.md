- **Ensure Clear Distinctions:**
  - **Visual Clarity:** Make sure different heading levels are visually distinct to help readers navigate the document easily.
  - **Example:** Main headings (H1) in a larger font size, subheadings (H2) in a slightly smaller size, and further subdivisions (H3) in an even smaller size.

### **7. Use Keywords**

- **Incorporate Relevant Terms:**
  - **Optimize for Search:** Use keywords or key phrases that reflect the content and are likely to be searched for by readers.
  - **Example:** For a section on troubleshooting, use “Common Error Messages” instead of just “Errors.”

- **Reflect Document Goals:**
  - **Align with Purpose:** Ensure that headings and subheadings align with the document’s goals and help achieve its objectives.
  - **Example:** In a technical manual, headings should reflect user tasks or procedures, such as “Installing the Software” or “Configuring Settings.”

### **8. Test for Readability**

- **Get Feedback:**
  - **Ask for Input:** Test your headings and subheadings with a sample of your intended audience to ensure they are clear and effective.
  - **Example:** Conduct a quick survey or review session to gauge how easily users can find and understand the information based on your headings.

- **Revise as Needed:**
  - **Be Open to Changes:** Revise headings based on feedback to improve clarity and usability.
  - **Example:** If users find certain headings ambiguous, adjust them to better reflect the content.

By adhering to these best practices, you can create headings and subheadings that enhance the readability, organization, and overall effectiveness of your technical documents.
